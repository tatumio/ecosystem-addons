# üåê CPFP Fee Estimator

The CPFP Fee Estimator is a powerful extension of the Tatum SDK, designed specifically to provide accurate fee estimation for Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) transactions on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Testnet networks.

## üìñ Description

The CPFP Fee Estimator enhances the efficiency and reliability of Bitcoin transactions. It is particularly useful in scenarios where unconfirmed transactions are stuck due to low fees. Key features include:

- Estimating fees for CPFP transactions.
- Processing multiple pending transactions for fee calculation.

This extension is built on top of the robust and secure infrastructure provided by the Tatum SDK, ensuring reliability and ease of integration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Installation**

   Ensure that `@tatumio/tatum` and `@tatumio/cpfp-fee-estimator` are installed in your project. Then, import the `CpfpFeeEstimator` extension:

   ```typescript
   import { CpfpFeeEstimator } from '@tatumio/cpfp-fee-estimator';
   ```

2. **Initialization**

   Create an instance of the Tatum SDK and integrate the `CpfpFeeEstimator`:

   ```typescript
   const tatumSdk = TatumSDK.init<Bitcoin>({
        network: Network.BITCOIN,
        configureExtensions: [CpfpFeeEstimator],
        version: ApiVersion.V3,
   });
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

To estimate the additional fee required for a CPFP transaction:

   **Estimate the CPFP Fee**:

   Call the `estimateCPFPFee` method with the transaction ID of the unconfirmed parent transaction:

```typescript
    const additionalFee = await tatumSdk.extension(CpfpFeeEstimator).estimateCPFPFee('parent-transaction-id');
    console.log(`Additional Fee Required: ${additionalFee} satoshis`);
```

   This method processes the parent transaction and its descendants to calculate the total additional fee required to expedite their confirmations.
   Note that the additional fee required should be increased by the fee of the transaction spending the outputs.

## üîó Supported Networks

The CPFP Fee Estimator supports the following networks:

- `Network.BITCOIN`
- `Network.BITCOIN_TESTNET`

By utilizing the CPFP Fee Estimator, developers can significantly improve the likelihood of transaction confirmations in congested network conditions, thereby enhancing the reliability and user experience of their Bitcoin transactions.
